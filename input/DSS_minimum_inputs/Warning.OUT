 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 1990 326
 Surface runoff curve number has been changed from   1.0 to  25.0.             

 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 1990 326
 The pH of one or more soil layers at initialization                           
 was outside the range pH=1-10, which is unlikely.                             
 It was set by DSSAT to pH=7.

 Default residue characteristics will be used.                                 

 SOLORG  YEAR DOY = 1990 326
 The initialized C:N ratio of the soil organic                                 
 matter (humus) in layer   9 is unlikely:      8.9                             
 A C:N ratio of 10.0 will be used to calculate initial soil organic N.         
 Please check your SOIL.SOL file.
