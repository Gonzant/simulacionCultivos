 Surface runoff curve number has been changed from   1.0 to  25.0.             

 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 1990 302
 The pH of one or more soil layers at initialization                           
 was outside the range pH=1-10, which is unlikely.                             
 It was set by DSSAT to pH=7.
