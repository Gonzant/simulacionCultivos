 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 2000 288
 Surface runoff curve number has been changed from   1.0 to  25.0.             

 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 2000 288
 The pH of one or more soil layers at initialization                           
 was outside the range pH=1-10, which is unlikely.                             
 It was set by DSSAT to pH=7.                                                  

 SOLORG  YEAR DOY = 2000 288
 The initialized C:N ratio of the soil organic                                 
 matter (humus) in layer   1 is unlikely:      9.7                             
 A C:N ratio of 10.0 will be used to calculate initial soil organic N.
